When making changes that require actions to be performed as part of the next
release, note such things here.

When finished with a new release, clear out the done/obsoleted items.

* dbctl will require a schema migration because of the new fields added.
  https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dbctl#Schema_upgrades

* dbctl will be generating new a output key in mwconfig as well, hostsByName.

* The above two things mean that you will need to update the JSON and YAML
  schemas in Puppet as part of deploying the new dbctl binaries.  Currently
  there is no automation for this, and the files are different, and require
  merging of changes by hand.  Both those issues should be fixed at some point.
  * If you deploy a new binary, and do not deploy a new schema, you will break
    config generation!  Don't do that.

* As of f5dbdda, confctl no longer requires being run with special sudo args
  to use the proper etcd permissions.  Publicize this on ops@.
