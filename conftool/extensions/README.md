Conftool extensions
===================

This submodule is used for domain-specific applications we might want to add to
conftool that are not part of the main software.

Here is a list of current extensions:

* `dbconfig` provides the `dbctl` command that can be used to modify MediaWiki's
  database configurations.
* `reqconfig` provides the `requestctl` command that can be used to modify how our
  edge caches treat requests.


For further details, refer to the README.md file within each extension directory.
